# How to Use This Repo (Interview + Real Work)

## Interview usage
- Pick one case study (folder `11_case_study/`) and explain:
  - objective, scope, risks
  - which controls you tested
  - what evidence you asked for
  - example finding + remediation tracking

## Real audit usage (template workflow)
1. Copy `01_context_and_scope/` into a new audit engagement folder
2. Use `02_risk_assessment/` to create the risk universe
3. Use `04_control_assessments/` to build your test plan
4. Use `05_evidence_review/` to request/validate evidence
5. Use `06_findings_and_reporting/` for reporting and risk ratings
