## Risk Identification (Example Risk Universe)

Create a risk universe grouped by domains:
- IAM: privileged access, MFA coverage, joiner/mover/leaver failures
- Network: segmentation gaps, firewall rule hygiene
- Logging: missing critical logs, weak alert coverage, poor retention
- Vulnerability management: scan coverage, SLAs, exception process
- Cloud: misconfigurations, weak identity posture, shadow IT
- IR: unclear roles, missing runbooks, no post-incident learning

For each risk:
- asset/process impacted
- threat scenario
- impact + likelihood drivers
- existing controls
