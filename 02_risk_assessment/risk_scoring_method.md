## Simple Risk Scoring (Practical)

Score 1–5 for Impact and Likelihood.

Impact drivers:
- data sensitivity, business criticality, regulatory exposure

Likelihood drivers:
- exposure, threat activity, control maturity, history of incidents

Inherent Risk = Impact × Likelihood  
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk adjusted by control effectiveness (High/Med/Low maturity)
