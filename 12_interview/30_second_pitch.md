## 30-second interview pitch

“I built an audit playbook to show how I run an information security audit end-to-end:
scope and risk universe → control test program → evidence validation → reporting and action tracking.
I include templates like an RCM, sample evidence requests, and sample findings so I can demonstrate
structured audit thinking in interviews.”
