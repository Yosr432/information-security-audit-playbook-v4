## Cloud Security Governance Assessment (Test Program)

Focus: governance and guardrails (not deep engineering).

### Test procedures
1) Policies: cloud security policy, shared responsibility, baseline configurations.
2) Identity: MFA/conditional access coverage; privileged roles review.
3) Monitoring: cloud logs ingested; sign-in risk monitoring.
4) Configuration: sample 5 resources → check against baseline (storage public access, key mgmt).
5) Change governance: IaC controls or change approvals.

### Evidence
- policy documents
- Azure/AWS security center dashboards (export)
- conditional access policy list (redacted)
