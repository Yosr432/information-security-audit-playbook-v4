## Vulnerability Management Assessment (Test Program)

### Control objectives
- Asset inventory exists and scan coverage is adequate.
- Findings are prioritized and remediated within agreed SLAs.
- Exceptions are documented and approved.

### Test procedures
1) Coverage: compare CMDB/inventory vs scanner coverage.
2) SLAs: sample 10 critical/high vulns → validate fix dates vs SLA.
3) Exceptions: review 3 exceptions → approval, compensating controls, expiry.
4) Reporting: verify metrics (aging, backlog) and governance cadence.

### Evidence examples
- scanner dashboard export
- remediation tickets
- exception register
